summary: 'The biggest advantage of using web-technology for building applications is the ability to deliver incremental results fast. That fits right into an agile mindset, where short cycles of development lead from idea to prototype to usable software that can be incrementally shipped. Those ideas work best with component thinking, not only in terms of front-end components, but also in composition of webservices and APIs.'

Over the last years thinking in components, microservices and microfrontends has taken over our mindsets that previously saw application building more from a monolithic perspective. Generally composing applications from library packages, UI components, APIs and SAAS is now a best practice. However, like every solution for web software architecture there are drawbacks that come together with the obvious benefits.

As a software architect I have to weigh the more or less obvious upsides against the sometimes not so obvious downsides and create solutions that are sustainable, maintainable, humane, performant and offer great user experience. With my personal background and work history, I judge things regarding innovation and creativity as well as if they're 'enterprise ready'.

## What does that even mean, "Composable Web"?

In a broader sense the web has evolved from a collection of hyperlinked documents to what we we now perceive as a giant database of information, a social network and an application platform.

### composition, craftsmanship, creativity
