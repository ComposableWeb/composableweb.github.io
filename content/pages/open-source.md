OS matters for a couple of very different reasons depending on who you ask.
Developers like the fact that they do not need to reinvent the wheel, do not need to maintain all libraries that they use and on the other hand find a great community to collaborate with likeminded people.
Businesses profit from Open-Source because the money that they spend goes into customization and building great products and not into licence fees for ready made solutions that only almost do what's needed with the price of being locked-in with the vendor.
End-Users might not always know of the fact that the service or app they are using is built with OS software, but they might notice the difference, because software that is built by people that do care more of why and how also care more about inclusiveness and accessability and that shows in usability.
